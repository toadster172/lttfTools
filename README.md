This repository contains reverse engineered documentation for some of the file formats used in TT Fusion's games, most notably the handheld versions of Traveller's Tales' LEGO games. Also included are some very rudimentary tools for working with these formats. Information for the documentation was reverse engineered from the DS version of LEGO Harry Potter Years 1-4 and the tools have been tested on that game and the DS version of LEGO Indiana Jones 2. For other games and platforms, formats may be the same, have subtle differences, or be completely different.
